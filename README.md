# Number_Guessing_Game
This is a simple guessing game where the program tries to guess the number the user thinks of between 1 and 99. The program starts by randomly generating a number between 1 and 99 and asks the user if their number is higher or lower than the guess. Based on the response, the program adjusts its guess and continues until it correctly guesses the number.
